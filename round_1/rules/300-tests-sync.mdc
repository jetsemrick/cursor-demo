- Update imports in tests when components/services are renamed to `.tsx`/`.ts`.
- Adjust React Testing Library patterns for functional components (no instance methods).
- Replace `enzyme`-style patterns if present with RTL idioms (queries + user events).
- Ensure tests remain green logically; do not change expected behavior without necessity.
- Prefer explicit imports from testing libraries and consistent async patterns (`findBy*`, `await`).
