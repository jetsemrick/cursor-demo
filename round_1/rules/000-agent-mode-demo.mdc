description: "Agent Mode demo rules for modernizing React class to Hooks + TypeScript within 'agent-mode'. Emphasize decisive, multi-file edits without running commands."

- Treat this as a pure refactor demo. Do not run commands, install packages, or modify build config.
- Prefer TypeScript for all updated files. When touching a `.jsx` or `.js` file in `agent-mode/`, migrate to `.tsx` or `.ts`.
- Keep behavior and public APIs identical; avoid UI or API changes.
- After renames, update all imports across `agent-mode/` to the new file extensions.
- Preserve existing export style (default vs named) unless a change is clearly required by TypeScript.
- Avoid adding TODO comments; implement the necessary edits directly.
- Keep changes minimal, focused, and high-quality for a 2-minute demo.
